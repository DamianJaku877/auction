        # Unique name of your homepage: used to compute stable namespaces for cache keys.

        # The "homepage" cache stores to the filesystem by default.
        # The data in this cache should persist between deploys.
        # Other options include:

        # Redis
        #homepage: cache.adapter.redis
        #default_redis_provider: redis://localhost

        # APCu (not recommended with heavy random-write workloads as memory fragmentation can cause perf issues)
        #homepage: cache.adapter.apcu

        # Namespaced pools use the above "homepage" backend by default
        #pools:
            #my.dedicated.cache: null
